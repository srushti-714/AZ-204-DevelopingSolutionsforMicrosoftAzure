# Lab: Automate business processes with Logic Apps

## Lab scenario

Your organization keeps a collection of JSON files that it uses to configure third-party products in a Server Message Block (SMB) file share in Microsoft Azure. As part of a regular auditing practice, the operations team would like to call a simple HTTP endpoint and retrieve the current list of configuration files. You have decided to implement this functionality using a no-code solution based on Azure API Management service and Logic Apps.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a Logic App workflow.

-   Manage products and APIs in a Logic App.

-   Use Azure API Management as a proxy for a Logic App.

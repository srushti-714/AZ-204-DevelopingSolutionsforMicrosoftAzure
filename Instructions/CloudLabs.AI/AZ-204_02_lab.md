# Lab: Implement task processing logic by using Azure Functions 

## Lab scenario

Your company has built a desktop software tool that parses a local JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file for its configuration settings. During its latest meeting, your team decided to reduce the number of files that are distributed with your application by serving your default configuration settings from a URL instead of from a local file. As the new developer on the team, you've been tasked with evaluating Microsoft Azure Functions as a solution to this problem.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a Functions app.

-   Create various functions by using built-in triggers.

-   Configure function app triggers and input integrations.
